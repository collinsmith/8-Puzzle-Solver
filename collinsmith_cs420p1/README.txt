CS 240 - Artificial Intelligence

This program was written in Java 8 and requires a Java 8 compiler. It was originally
written in NetBeans IDE 8.0, however it should compile via the command line just fine.
Results for randomly generated puzzles will be outputted into ".\output\output.txt".
Note that ".\output\" must already exist.
